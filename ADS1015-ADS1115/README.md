# ADS1X15

This simple Lua script is an adaptation from the [Adafruit driver](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ADS1X15)

I just discovered Lua scripting, so it might be very dirty

If you have any idea of improvment just ask for a pull request ! :smile:

## Requirements

In order to work properly, this script needs your NodeMCU to embed at least :
 - `bit` module
 
 > Used to manipulate bits, for more, read the [manual](http://nodemcu.readthedocs.org/en/dev/en/modules/bit/)
 
 - `i2c` module
 
 > Library for i2c protocol, for more, read the [manual](http://nodemcu.readthedocs.org/en/dev/en/modules/i2c/)
